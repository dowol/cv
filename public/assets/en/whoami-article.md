### 👨‍💻 I am a person like these:

I use JavaScript/Typescript, C#, and Python mainly, and I focus to develop
web frontends with React, web backends with node.js and express.js, 
and Windows apps with .NET platform and WPF.  

I've been interested in software development since 6th grade. So I entered a 
department of computer engineering in university to acquiring the knowledge
and skills necessary for software development. I'm now waiting a graduation 
from university and looking for a job.
